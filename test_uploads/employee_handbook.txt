Welcome to TechCorp! We are a leading provider of cloud-based customer

2.2 At-Will Employment

Employment at TechCorp is at-will unless you have a written employment
contract stating otherwise. This means that either you or TechCorp may

a contract of employment or a guarantee of continued employment.

2.3 Background Checks

All offers of employment are contingent upon successful completion of

HR and Legal due to tax, immigration, and data residency implications.

for other confidential information.

========================================================================
9. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
========================================================================

9.1 Performance Review Cycle

TechCorp conducts a formal performance review process twice per year:
  - Mid-Year Review (June-July): Checkpoint on goals, feedback, and
    development areas. No rating or compensation changes.
  - Annual Review (December-January): Comprehensive review with
    formal rating, compensation adjustment, and equity refresh.

9.2 Goal Setting

At the start of each half, employees collaborate with their manager to
set 3-5 measurable objectives using the OKR (Objectives and Key
Results) framework. Goals should be ambitious but achievable, aligned
with team and company priorities.

9.3 Continuous Feedback

Managers are expected to provide regular, ongoing feedback through:
  - Weekly 1:1 meetings (minimum 30 minutes)
  - Written feedback after major projects or milestones
  - Real-time recognition for strong contributions

Employees are encouraged to solicit feedback from peers and skip-level
managers through the 360-degree feedback tool.

9.4 Performance Ratings

The annual review uses a 5-point rating scale:
  - 1 - Does Not Meet Expectations: Significant performance gaps
  - 2 - Partially Meets Expectations: Some areas need improvement
  - 3 - Meets Expectations: Solid, reliable performance
  - 4 - Exceeds Expectations: Consistently strong results
  - 5 - Exceptional: Extraordinary impact, role-model behavior

Compensation adjustments and promotion decisions are informed by
performance ratings, market data, and internal equity considerations.

9.5 Performance Improvement Plans (PIP)

Employees receiving a rating of 1 or 2 may be placed on a Performance
Improvement Plan. PIPs are 60-90 days and include:
  - Specific, measurable improvement objectives
  - Weekly check-ins with the manager
  - Resources and support for improvement
  - Clear consequences if objectives are not met

  1. Verbal Warning: Informal conversation documented in manager notes
  2. Written Warning: Formal written notice, placed in employee file
  3. Final Written Warning: Last notice before potential termination
  4. Termination: Separation from employment

The severity of the offense determines the starting point. Serious
violations (theft, violence, harassment, data breach) may result in
immediate termination without progressive steps.

10.2 Suspension

In cases requiring investigation, TechCorp may place an employee on
paid administrative leave pending the outcome. Suspension does not
imply guilt and is not considered a disciplinary action.
